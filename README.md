# Sales-data-cleaning-project
Cleaning sales data for future analysis

🧱 1. Start with the problem
This sets the scene and shows you understand real‑world data challenges.

Example:

“This project focuses on transforming a raw sales dataset containing common real‑world issues such as missing values, inconsistent date formats, duplicate records, and incorrect data types.”

This immediately signals:
✔ You know what messy data looks like
✔ You can diagnose problems
✔ You’re not just running code — you’re thinking like an analyst

🧼 2. Explain your cleaning goals
This shows intentionality, not just random cleaning steps.

Example:

“The goal was to build a reproducible cleaning pipeline that standardises the dataset, ensures accuracy, and prepares it for downstream analysis.”

This frames you as someone who works systematically.

🛠️ 3. Describe the cleaning steps in a structured way
Break it into clear, readable sections. Recruiters love this.

Example:

Cleaning Steps
Identified and removed duplicate transactions

Standardised date formats to YYYY‑MM‑DD

Corrected inconsistent product names using mapping rules

Handled missing values using imputation and domain logic

Converted data types (e.g., strings → integers, floats)

Created new fields (e.g., cleaned revenue, standardised categories)

Validated totals and cross‑checked against expected ranges

This shows depth and technical competence.

🔁 4. Highlight reproducibility
This is a huge green flag for employers.

Example:

“All cleaning steps were implemented in a reusable Python pipeline using pandas, allowing the process to be applied to future datasets with minimal modification.”

This makes you look like someone who thinks beyond one‑off scripts.

📊 5. Show the before/after impact
This is where you demonstrate value.

Example:

Results
Reduced 3,200 duplicate rows

Standardised 12 inconsistent product labels

Fixed 8 different date formats

Improved data completeness from 87% to 99%

Produced a clean dataset ready for KPI analysis

Even if the numbers are approximate, the structure is perfect.

🧠 6. Add a short reflection
This is where you show maturity and awareness.

Example:

“This project demonstrates my ability to work with imperfect real‑world data, design cleaning logic, and build reliable pipelines that support accurate analysis.”

This ties the whole narrative together.
